<h6> For years, real estate has been a bystander to technological upheaval, but that may be changing as the historically tech-lagged sector comes into the epicenter of a technological revolution.This use of technology to improve property services includes anything from increasing use of big data to the adoption of a distributed database, such as blockchain technology, to even creations like robot receptionists.

	At a recent proptech panel discussion hosted at the Tech in Asia Singapore conference, JLL Asia Pacific CEO Anthony Couse said: "The next five years is critical to anyone in the real estate sector, whether you are a service provider, or in the world of developing or investing in real estate."
	
	The real estate industry has traditionally been hesitant to accept new technologies. While there are several reasons for its apprehension toward artificial intelligence, the most important aspect is the technology's core. AI applications are only as strong as the data sets supplied into them, both in number and quality.Our AI experts believe that the major hurdle to AI adoption in real estate is fragmented, unstructured, and often costly data. Real estate is the world's second least digital industry, according to the Morgan Stanley Digitization Index. However, in recent years, many industry actors have begun to appreciate AI's enormous potential.
	
	With the ongoing digitization of our world, the number of data sources has increased tremendously. More critically, huge corporations are beginning to move toward improved data organization. Every bit of information retrieved from anything, from user-generated content to property price variations, may be recorded, analyzed, and converted into useful insights. According to PwC, artificial intelligence will contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.</p>
<ins>Let's take a look at how artificial intelligence is now changing real estate</ins>
<br>
<br>
When it comes to major assets, such as corporate office buildings, real estate maintenance expenditures can consume a significant portion of the budget. According to the 2018 JIL Occupancy Benchmarking Report, 30-40% of office space is unused. This is sometimes referred to as'silent costs,' because money losses are not immediately obvious. Aside from paying extra for energy usage or empty square feet, poorly managed business space frequently contributes to employee unhappiness.

IBM has launched its AI-powered TRIRIGA solution to assist real estate management professionals in making better use of office space. TRIRIGA collects data from a variety of sources, including Wi-Fi and IoT devices, which is then processed by an AI system and converted into useful insights. This has the potential to help businesses make better decisions about how to manage their workspaces.
<br>
<br>
<ins>AI Improves Home Search Experience</ins>
<br><br>
Searching for a permanent place to live may be a stressful task. Almost every home-searching engine filters out the best properties based on factors such as price, location, number of rooms, size, and so on. Although this technique has shown to be beneficial, it frequently presents potential purchasers with much more options than they are ready to consider. This is where artificial intelligence-based algorithms come into play..

The algorithm then places the most relevant entries at the front of the search results and suggests more items as needed. It also takes into account the preferences of other users who have looked at related properties, which aids in anticipating consumers' interests after only a few search queries and allows for a higher level of customisation.</h6></div>
